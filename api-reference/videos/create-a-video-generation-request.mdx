<Warning>
### Video Generation is a Beta Feature
Only the **Seedance 1.0 Pro Fast** model is supported for video generation. Because this model is exclusively accessible through approved API providers, the `safetyLevel` parameter is automatically enforced at `high` and may be omitted in all requests.

Video generation does not yet support NSFW scanning. The `safetyLevel` parameter is currently ignored and `results.[].isNSFW` will always return `null`. We plan to introduce full NSFW scanning support in the next API update.
</Warning>

<Note>
### Aspect Ratios and Dimensions
For video models, the `dimensions` parameter determines both the resolution of the video and the width x height in pixels. The exact pixel dimensions are defined by the combination of the chosen resolution and aspect ratio, so it's important to select an aspect ratio that is supported for the chosen resolution.
